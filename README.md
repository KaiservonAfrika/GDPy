Generating Deep Learning Potential with Python (GDPy/GDPÂ¥) is a bundle of codes for machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) developments, especially for its application in heterogeneous catalysis.

It mainly includes methods for structure exploration and a unified interface to various MLIPs. The target system can be metal oxides, supported clusters, and solid-liquid interfaces.

# Features
- Automation workflow to dataset construction and MLIP training.
- A unified interface to various MLIPs.
- Versatile exploration algorithms to construct a general dataset.
